## Data Hub
This page has been set up to collate and share data resources being used
or produced by members of the
[Emergent Alliance](https://emer2gent.org). It is powered by
a distributed set of index files, which you can read more about on our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/odileeds/emer2gent-data).
