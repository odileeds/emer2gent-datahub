    This is a document to openly collate useful open data sources and references
    related to COVID-19, to support our collaborative #OpenDataSavesLives
    coronavirus work. Please add anything you think is useful, and share this
    document widely - this way we all get a single place where we can quickly
    find the data we need, we cut down on research time and we remove
    unnecessary duplication of effort.  For general notes, ideas, etc please put
    these in our collaborative working document. Please try to add as much
    information as possible - the geography & granularity is particularly
    useful.
