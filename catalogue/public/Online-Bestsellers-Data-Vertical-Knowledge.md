  description: "Since April of 2013, Vertical Knowledge has tracked a daily collection of US bestseller information across 32 categories. This collection includes purchased products by date and product name linked to brand name as well as both the product list price and final sale price across thousands of public and private companies.\r\n\r\nThis data can be leveraged to gain day-by-day insights into the Retail sector to help predict product segment level sales and trends for a given company; across competitors; and for a given sub-industry. Consumer sentiment data is reflected by a 1-5 product rating scale complete with the count of ratings for each product that you can correlate with sales and pricing data as another predictor of where each product/brand is likely to trend. This data set has historically been very valuable to investment managers in understanding product launches and consumer reception. Upon launch of a next generation product, comparisons can be made to previous generations adoption and gain insight into the relative viability of the new product.\r\n\r\nCategories Include:\r\n\r\nAppliances\r\nAppstore for Android\r\nArts, Crafts & Sewing\r\nAutomotive\r\nBaby\r\nBeauty\r\nBooks\r\nCamera & Photo\r\nCell Phones & Accessories\r\nComputers & Accessories\r\nElectronics\r\nGift Cards Store\r\nGrocery & Gourmet Food\r\nHealth & Personal Care\r\nHome & Kitchen\r\nHome Improvement\r\nIndustrial & Scientific\r\nKindle Store\r\nKitchen & Dining\r\nMP3 Downloads\r\nMagazines\r\nMovies & TV\r\nMusic\r\nMusical Instruments\r\nOffice Products\r\nPatio, Lawn & Garden\r\nPet Supplies\r\nSoftware\r\nSports & Outdoors\r\nToys & Games\r\nVideo Games\r\nClothing, Shoes & Jewelry"
