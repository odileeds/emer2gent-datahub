  description: "Copernicus builds on a constellations of satellites making a vast number of daily observations, as well as on a global network of thousands of land-, air- and marine-based sensors to create the most detailed pictures of Earth. The technological evolution, especially in terms of availability and accessibility, has made Copernicus the largest space data provider in the world, currently producing 12 terabytes per day.\r\nThe vast majority of data and information delivered by the Copernicus Space infrastructure and the Copernicus services are made available and accessible to any citizen and any organisation around the world on a free, full and open access basis."
