    To aid researchers, data scientists, and analysts in an effort to combat
    COVID-19, we are hosting a repository of public datasets like Johns Hopkins
    Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE), the US Census
    Bureau's American Community Survey (ACS), and OpenStreetMaps data free to
