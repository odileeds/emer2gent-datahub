        The economic sentiment indicator (ESI) is a composite indicator produced
        by the Directorate General for Economic and Financial Affairs (DG ECFIN)
        of the European Commission. Its objective is to track GDP growth at
        Member states, EU and euro area levels. The ESI is a weighted average of
        the balances of replies to selected questions addressed to firms in five
        sectors covered by the EU Business and Consumer Surveys and to
        consumers. The sectors covered are industry (weight 40 %), services (30
        %), consumers (20 %), retail (5 %) and construction (5 %). Balances are
        constructed as the difference between the percentages of respondents
        giving positive and negative replies. EU and euro-area aggregates are
        calculated on the basis of the national results and seasonally adjusted.
        The ESI is scaled to a long-term mean of 100 and a standard deviation of
        10. Thus, values above 100 indicate above-average economic sentiment and
        vice versa. Data are seasonally adjusted (SA).
