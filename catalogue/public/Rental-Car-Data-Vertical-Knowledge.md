  description: "Since October of 2017, Vertical Knowledge captures weekly car rental pricing data from nine rental car companies across the top 50 US airports. Vertical Knowledge collects pricing for different periods (weekly, weekend, weekday), and different future time periods (3 months, 2 months, 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, and a few days). These data points span across car types (mid-size, full-size, SUV, etc.).\r\n\r\nThis data set enables investors to understand relative pricing trends across brands and year-over-year price comparisons. In addition to analyzing the Rental Car industry, the data provides useful insights into the travel industry and airport volumes."
