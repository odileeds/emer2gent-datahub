  description: "Since November of 2018, Vertical Knowledge has tracked key metrics weekly, and more recently, daily on global flight paths, fares, capacity and aircraft platforms. This provides information on competitive fares, popular flight pairing and associated capacity.\r\n \r\nThis data can be leveraged to gain day-by-day insights into the airline sector. COVID-G19 has increased the demand for this data and can assist in understand the impact the pandemic is having on the airline industry as well as predict encouraging signs of recovery."
